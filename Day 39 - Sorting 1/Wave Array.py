Problem Description
Given an array of integers A, sort the array into a wave like array and return it, In other words, arrange the elements
into a sequence such that
a1 >= a2 <= a3 >= a4 <= a5â€¦..
NOTE : If there are multiple answers possible, return the one that's lexicographically smallest.


Problem Constraints
1 <= len(A) <= 106
1 <= A[i] <= 106


Input Format
First argument is an integer array A.


Output Format
Return an array arranged in the sequence as described.


Example Input
Input 1:
A = [1, 2, 3, 4]

Input 2:
A = [1, 2]


Example Output
Output 1:
[2, 1, 4, 3]

Output 2:
[2, 1]


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
One possible answer : [2, 1, 4, 3]
Another possible answer : [4, 1, 3, 2]
First answer is lexicographically smallest. So, return [2, 1, 4, 3].

Explanation 1:
Only possible answer is [2, 1].


See Expected Output
Your input
8 1 2 3 3 3 6 7 8
Output
2 1 3 3 6 3 8 7

"""
Solution Approach
array = {5, 1, 3, 4, 2}

Sort the above array. 

array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Now swap adjacent elemets in pairs.

swap(1, 2)
swap(3, 4)

Now, our array = {2, 1, 4, 3, 5}

and voila!, the array is in the wave form.
