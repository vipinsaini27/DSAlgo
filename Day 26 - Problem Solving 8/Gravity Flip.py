Problem Description
Little Chris is bored during his physics lessons (too easy), so he has built a toy box to keep himself occupied. The box
is special, since it has the ability to change gravity.
There are n columns of toy cubes in the box arranged in a line. The i-th column contains ai cubes. At first, the gravity
in the box is pulling the cubes downwards. When Chris switches the gravity, it begins to pull all the cubes to the right
side of the box. The figure shows the initial and final configurations of the cubes in the box: the cubes that have
changed their position are highlighted with orange.
Given the initial configuration of the toy cubes in the box, find the amounts of cubes in each of the n columns after
the gravity switch!

Problem Constraints
1<=n<=100
1<=A[i]<=100

Input Format
First argument is array of integers of size n denoting the columns.

Output Format
Return the array of integers denoting the amount of cubes of the n columns after the gravity switch!

Example Input
INPUT-1
A=[3 2 1 2]
INPUT-2
A=[2 3 8 ]

Example Output
output-1
1 2 2 3
output-2
2 3 8

Example Explanation
Explanation-1
The first example case is shown on the figure. The top cube of the first column falls to the top of the last column; the top cube of the second column falls to the top of the third column; the middle cube of the first column falls to the top of the second column.
Explanation-2
In the second example case the gravity switch does not change the heights of the columns.
"""

"""
Solution Approach
Observe that in the final configuration the heights of the columns are in non-decreasing order.
Also, the number of columns of each height remains the same. 
This means that the answer to the problem is the sorted sequence of the given column heights.
Solution complexity: O(n), since we can sort by counting.
