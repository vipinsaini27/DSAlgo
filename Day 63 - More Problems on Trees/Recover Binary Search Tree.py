Problem Description
Two elements of a binary search tree (BST), represented by root A are swapped by mistake. Tell us the 2 values swapping which the tree will be restored.

A solution using O(n) space is pretty straightforward. Could you devise a constant space solution?



Problem Constraints
1 <= size of tree <= 100000



Input Format
First and only argument is the head of the tree,A



Output Format
Return the 2 elements which need to be swapped.



Example Input
Input 1:

 
         1
        / \
       2   3
Input 2:

 
         2
        / \
       3   1



Example Output
Output 1:

 [2, 1]
Output 2:

 [3, 1]


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

Swapping 1 and 2 will change the BST to be 
         2
        / \
       1   3
which is a valid BST 
Explanation 2:

Swapping 1 and 3 will change the BST to be 
         2
        / \
       1   3
which is a valid BST
