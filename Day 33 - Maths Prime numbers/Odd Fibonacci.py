Problem Description
Given two integers A and B representing an interval [A, B].
Fibonacci sequence is a sequence whose definition is as follows:
F[1] = 1 , F[2] = 1
F[i] = F[i-1] + F[i-2] for i > 2
Your task is to find the count of integers x in the range [A, B] such that F[x] is odd.

Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 109
1 <= B <= 109
A <= B


Input Format
The first argument given is an integer A.
The second argument given is an integer B.

Output Format
Return the count of integers x in the range [A, B] such that F[x] is odd.

Example Input
Input 1:
 A = 2
 B = 6

Input 2:
 A = 6
 B = 20

Example Output
Output 1:
3
Output 2:
 10

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 All x and their F[x] values:
    x = 2, F[x] = 1
    x = 3, F[x] = 2
    x = 4, F[x] = 3
    x = 5, F[x] = 5
    x = 6, F[x] = 8
 From the above values only three values are odd.

Solution Approach
For every multiple of 3 itâ€™s fibonacci is even.

Like: F[3]=2, F[6]=8, F[9]=34

So Just find the count of multiples of 3 between A and B and subtract it from total numbers between A and B.

Total Numbers Between A and B = B - A +1

Count of Multiples of 3 between A and B = (B/3) - ((A-1)/3)

So answer will be = (B-A+1) - ((B/3)-((A-1)/3))

        b = B - B//3

        return b - a
