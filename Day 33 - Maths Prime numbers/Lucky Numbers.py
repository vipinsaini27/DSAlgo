Problem Description
A lucky number is a number which has exactly 2 distinct prime divisors.

You are given a number A and you need to determine the count of lucky numbers between the range 1 to A (both inclusive).


Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 50000


Input Format
The first and only argument is an integer A.


Output Format
Return an integer i.e the count of lucky numbers between 1 and A, both inclusive.


Example Input
Input 1:
 A = 8

Input 2:
 A = 12


Example Output
Output 1:
 1

Output 2:
 3


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 Between [1, 8] there is only 1 lucky number i.e 6.
 6 has 2 distinct prime factors i.e 2 and 3.

Explanation 2:
 Between [1, 12] there are 3 lucky number: 6, 10 and 12.

Solution Approach
Firstly, create an array letâ€™s say isprime where isprime[i] denotes true or false if number i is prime or not.

Now, for every number in the range [1, A] calculate the number of prime divisors and if the count of distinct prime 
factors for a number is 2 increment the answer.

This can be easily done in O(N * sqrt(N)).

The solution can further be optimised to run in O(N * log(N)). The idea is to use sieve and in place of marking a number 
non prime in the array while using sieve just add 1 to it for each prime you iterate. At the end you will have number of 
prime factors of each number. Then the rest is cake walk. There are other kinds of sieves as well that you should check 
out. These are quite fast in terms of processing.
