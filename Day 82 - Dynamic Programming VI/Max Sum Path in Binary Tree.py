Problem Description
Given a binary tree T, find the maximum path sum.

The path may start and end at any node in the tree.



Problem Constraints
1 <= Number of Nodes <= 7e4

-1000 <= Value of Node in T <= 1000



Input Format
The first and the only argument contains a pointer to the root of T, A.



Output Format
Return an integer representing the maximum sum path.



Example Input
Input 1:

  
    1
   / \
  2   3
Input 2:

       20
      /  \
   -10   20
        /  \
      -10  -50


Example Output
Output 1:

 6
Output 2:

 40


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

     The path with maximum sum is: 2 -> 1 -> 3
Explanation 2:

     The path with maximum sum is: 20 -> 20
