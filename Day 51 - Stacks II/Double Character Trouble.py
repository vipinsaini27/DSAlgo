Problem Description
You are given a string A.
An operation on the string is defined as follows:
Remove the first occurrence of the same consecutive characters. eg for a string "abbcd", the 
first occurrence of same consecutive characters is "bb".
Therefore the string after this operation will be "acd".
Keep performing this operation on the string until there are no more occurrences of the same 
consecutive characters and return the final string.

Problem Constraints
1 <= |A| <= 100000

Input Format
First and only argument is string A.

Output Format
Return the final string.

Example Input
Input 1:
 A = abccbc
Input 2:
 A = ab

Example Output
Output 1:
 "ac"
Output 2:
 "ab"

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
Remove the first occurrence of same consecutive characters. eg for a string "abbc", 
the first occurrence of same consecutive characters is "bb".
Therefore the string after this operation will be "ac".
Explanation 2:
 No removals are to be done.

"""
Solution Approach
Consider an example string abba.
When we remove the “bb”, the remaining string is “aa” which has to be removed as well.
So we need to keep track of the characters before the first occurrence of similar consecutive 
characters.
We can do this using a stack.
We keep pushing the characters in a stack, if the current character is equal to the top of the 
stack,
we pop from the stack since they represent
a pair of similar characters.
Finally, we print the stack in reverse.
