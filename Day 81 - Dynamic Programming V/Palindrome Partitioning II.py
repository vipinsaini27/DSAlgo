"""
Problem Description
Given a string A, partition A such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.

Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of A.



Problem Constraints
1 <= length(A) <= 501



Input Format
The first and the only argument contains the string A.



Output Format
Return an integer, representing the minimum cuts needed.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = "aba"
Input 2:

 A = "aab"


Example Output
Output 1:

 0
Output 2:

 1


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 "aba" is already a palindrome, so no cuts are needed.
Explanation 2:

 Return 1 since the palindrome partitioning ["aa","b"] could be produced using 1 cut.
