Problem Description
You are given a linked list that contains a loop.
You need to find the node, which creates a loop and break it by making the node point to NULL.



Problem Constraints
1 <= number of nodes <= 1000



Input Format
Only argument is the head of the linked list.



Output Format
return the head of the updated linked list.



Example Input
Input 1:

 
1 -> 2
^    |
| - - 
Input 2:

3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
          ^         |
          |         |    
          - - - - - -


Example Output
Output 1:

 1 -> 2 -> NULL
Output 2:

 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> NULL


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Chain of 1->2 is broken.
Explanation 2:

 Chain of 4->6 is broken.

"""
Solution Approach
You just need to find what the point is, which has 2 pointers pointing towards it.
Once you have found it, remove one of the pointers and return the head of the new linked list.
