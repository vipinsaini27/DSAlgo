Problem Description
Two players are playing a game. The rules are as follows:
Player 1 always moves first, and both players always play optimally.
Initially there are A piles, where each pile has B number of stones.
The players move in alternating turns. In each turn, a player can choose a pile of size x and reduce the number of
stones to y, where 1 <= y < x, and x and y are coprime.
If the current player is unable to make a move, they lose the game.
Determine the winner of the game.

Problem Constraints
1 ≤ A, B ≤ 106

Input Format
The first argument is A, the number of piles. The second argument is B, the number of stones in each pile initially.

Output Format
Return a single integer, 1 or 2, depending upon which player wins.

Example Input
Input 1:
 A = 2
 B = 2
Input 2:
 A = 3
 B = 1

Example Output
Output 1:
 2
Output 2:
 2

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 The only possible scenario is player 1 chooses any one pile and reduce it to 1. Then Player 2 reduces the other pile to
 1 and wins.
Explanation 2:
 There is no possible move for player 1. Hence, player 2 wins.

Solution Approach
Special Case: When B = 1, there is no possible move, therefore player 2 wins.

When A is even:

Imagine that the piles are separated into two groups having an equal number of A/2 towers in each group.
There is a 1 to 1 relationship between these two groups, whenever player 1 mutates one of the piles from the first 
group, player 2 can simply copy player 1's last move and apply it to a pile from the second group.
In this way, player 2 will always have move to make (i.e., the mirror of player 1's previous move), so player 2 will 
always win.
When A is odd:

Player 1 can choose one pile and reduce it to 1 (always coprime).
This results in A-1 piles each having B stones.
Now, Since A-1 is even and it is player 2's turn, Player 1 can follow the same strategy as above and win.
