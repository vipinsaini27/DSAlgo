Problem Description
Given a string A, you are asked to reverse the string and return the reversed string.

Problem Constraints
1 <= |A| <= 105
String A consist only of lowercase characters.

Input Format
First and only argument is a string A.

Output Format
Return a string denoting the reversed string.

Example Input
Input 1:
 A = "scaler"
Input 2:
 A = "academy"

Example Output
Output 1:
 "relacs"
Output 2:
 "ymedaca"

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 Reverse the given string.
"""

"""
Solution Approach
One idea is to create new string, iterate A in reverse order store each character in the new string.
Other is to do implace reverse operation on the string.
This can be done, by iterating the first half of the string, let’s say we are at index i then,
swap(A[i], A[n-i-1])
where n is the length of string.

    # @param A : string

        while i >= 0:

            i -= 1
