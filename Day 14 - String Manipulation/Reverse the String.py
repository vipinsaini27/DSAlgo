Problem Description
You are given a string A of size N.
Return the string A after reversing the string word by word.
NOTE:
A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.
Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces, even if it is present in the input string.
If there are multiple spaces between words, reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.

Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 3 * 105

Input Format
The only argument given is string A.

Output Format
Return the string A after reversing the string word by word.

Example Input
Input 1:
    A = "the sky is blue"
Input 2:
    A = "this is ib"

Example Output
Output 1:
    "blue is sky the"
Output 2:
    "ib is this"

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
    We reverse the string word by word so the string becomes "the sky is blue".
Explanation 2:
    We reverse the string word by word so the string becomes "this is ib".

Solution Approach
One simple approach is a two-pass solution:
First pass to split the string by spaces into an array of words
Then second pass to extract the words in reversed order
We can do better in one-pass. While iterating the string in reverse order, we keep track of a wordâ€™s beginning and end 
position.
When we are at the beginning of a word, we append it.
